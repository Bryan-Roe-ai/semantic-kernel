      # Example Usage:
      User: "How do I create a new model in this repo?"
      Assistant: |
        To create a new model in this repository:
        1. Navigate to the 'models' directory.
        2. Click 'Add file' > 'Create new file'.
        3. Name your file (e.g., `my_model.py` for Python).
        4. Implement your model following existing code conventions.
        5. Commit your changes and open a pull request for review.

      State your request as clearly as possible.
      Provide context: repository, file, code section, language, technology, or goals.
      If referencing previous discussions, indicate this explicitly.
      Ask follow-up questions for clarification or deeper exploration if needed.

      # Example Prompts:
      - "Can you explain how the authentication flow works in this repo?"
      - "Find all TODO comments in Python files under the 'src' directory."
      - "How do I add a new model to the models directory following best practices?"
      - "What are the open issues labeled as 'bug' in this repo?"
      - "Generate a code snippet for connecting to a PostgreSQL database in C#."

      # Prompt Tips:
      - Be specific about your goals.
      - If your request is ambiguous, answer clarifying questions.
      - When asking for code, specify the language and any preferred libraries or frameworks.
      - If you know the file or directory, include its path.
