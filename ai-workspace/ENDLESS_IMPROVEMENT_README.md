# 🔄 Endless Improvement Loop - Quick Start

A self-evolving system that continuously improves your AI workspace through intelligent automation, learning, and adaptation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Demo Mode (Recommended for first try)

```bash
cd /workspaces/semantic-kernel/ai-workspace
python scripts/launch_improvement.py --mode demo
```

This runs 3 improvement cycles with 1-minute intervals - perfect for seeing the system in action!

### Other Modes

```bash
# Test single cycle
python scripts/launch_improvement.py --mode test

# Continuous improvement (production)
python scripts/launch_improvement.py --mode continuous

# Fast cycles (1-minute intervals)
python scripts/launch_improvement.py --mode fast

# Custom configuration
python scripts/launch_improvement.py --mode custom --cycles 5 --interval 120
```

## 🧠 What It Does

The system consists of three intelligent agents that work together:

1. **🔧 Performance Agent** - Optimizes system resources, cleans up files, manages memory
2. **📝 Code Quality Agent** - Improves code coverage, adds documentation, refactors complex code
3. **🧠 Learning Agent** - Learns from past actions and continuously evolves improvement strategies

## 📊 Example Output

## 📁 Files Created

The system creates logs and reports in:

```
logs/
├── improvement_cycle_0001.json    # Individual cycle reports
├── improvement_cycle_0002.json
├── learning_history.json          # Learning data
├── experiments.json               # Experimental results
└── endless_improvement_final_report.json  # Final summary
```

## 🛑 Stopping the Loop

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to gracefully stop the improvement loop. It will save a final report before exiting.
