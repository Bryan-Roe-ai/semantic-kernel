# AI Workspace Index

This organized workspace provides a structured approach to AI development with Semantic Kernel.

## Directory Structure

### 01-notebooks/
Jupyter notebooks for AI experimentation, prototyping, and interactive development.

### 02-agents/
AI agents, agent frameworks, multi-agent systems, and collaboration tools.

### 03-models-training/
Model training scripts, fine-tuning utilities, and LLM development tools.

### 04-plugins/
Semantic Kernel plugins, extensions, and prompt templates.

### 05-samples-demos/
Sample applications, demonstrations, and example implementations.

### 06-backend-services/
Backend services, APIs, Azure Functions, and cloud integrations.

### 07-data-resources/
Datasets, training data, resources, and data processing utilities.

### 08-documentation/
Documentation, guides, tutorials, and reference materials.

### 09-deployment/
Deployment configurations, containerization, and CI/CD setups.

### 10-config/
Configuration files, environment settings, and project configurations.

## Quick Start

1. **Development Environment**: Check `10-config/` for environment setup
2. **Learning**: Start with `01-notebooks/` for interactive examples
3. **Building Agents**: Explore `02-agents/` for agent development
4. **Creating Plugins**: Use `04-plugins/` for extending functionality
5. **Deployment**: Reference `09-deployment/` for production setup

## Key Files

- `organize_files.py`: This organization script
- `ai_workspace_manager.py`: Workspace management utilities
- Various README.md files in each directory for specific guidance

## Usage Patterns

### For AI Research & Development:
1. Start in `01-notebooks/` for experimentation
2. Move to `03-models-training/` for custom model work
3. Use `07-data-resources/` for datasets and resources

### For Production AI Applications:
1. Begin with `05-samples-demos/` for reference implementations
2. Develop in `06-backend-services/` for scalable services
3. Deploy using `09-deployment/` configurations

### For Agent Development:
1. Study examples in `02-agents/`
2. Create plugins in `04-plugins/`
3. Test and iterate in `01-notebooks/`
