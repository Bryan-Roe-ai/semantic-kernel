## 🚀 How to Use Your New AI Monitoring System

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
cd .ai-monitoring

# 1. Start real-time dashboard (SEE ALL AI ACTIVITIES LIVE)
python ai_launcher.py dashboard

# 2. Check system status
python ai_launcher.py status

# 3. Generate activity reports
python ai_launcher.py report 24    # Last 24 hours

# 4. Test the system
python demo_monitoring.py

# 5. Organize repository (simulate first)
python ai_launcher.py organize-dry

# 6. Actually organize repository  
python ai_launcher.py organize
```

## 📁 Repository Structure (After Organization)

The system can reorganize your repository into this logical structure:

```
semantic-kernel/
├── 📁 01-core/                     # Core SK implementations
├── 📁 02-ai-workspace/             # Enhanced AI workspace  
├── 📁 03-samples/                  # All sample implementations
├── 📁 04-documentation/            # Consolidated documentation
├── 📁 05-infrastructure/           # DevOps and infrastructure
├── 📁 06-resources/                # Static resources and data
├── 📁 07-archive/                  # Archived/legacy content
└── 📁 .ai-monitoring/              # AI monitoring system ⭐
```
