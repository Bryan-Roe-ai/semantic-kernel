# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.

# This workflow integrates Pyre with GitHub's
# Code Scanning feature.
#
# Pyre is a performant type checker for Python compliant with
# PEP 484. Pyre can analyze codebases with millions of lines
# of code incrementally â€“ providing instantaneous feedback
# to developers as they write code.
