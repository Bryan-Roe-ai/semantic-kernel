## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository Secrets**: Configure the following secrets in your repository settings:

   ```
   AZURE_CREDENTIALS     # For Azure deployments
   PYPI_API_TOKEN       # For Python package publishing
   NUGET_API_KEY        # For .NET package publishing
   NPM_TOKEN            # For npm package publishing
   ```

2. **Repository Settings**:
   - Enable Issues and Discussions
   - Configure branch protection rules for `main` branch
   - Set up GitHub Pages if using static site deployment

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Configure**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd <your-repo>

   # Make sure cleanup script is executable
   chmod +x cleanup-workspace.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Workflow Permissions**:

   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
   - Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Customize Workflows**:
   - Update reviewer team names in `intelligent-issue-management.yml`
   - Adjust environment URLs in `deployment-automation.yml`
   - Modify quality thresholds in `code-quality-automation.yml`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Each workflow can be customized through environment variables:

```yaml
# Example configuration in workflow file
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"
  NODE_VERSION: "18"
  DOTNET_VERSION: "8.0.x"
  JAVA_VERSION: "11"
```

### Workflow Labels

The workflows use the following labels (create them in your repository):

**Issue Management**:

- `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `security`, `performance`
- `python`, `dotnet`, `java`, `typescript`
- `priority:high`, `stale`, `automated`

**Deployment**:

- `deployment`, `development`, `staging`, `production`
- `success`, `failure`

**Quality & Security**:

- `code-quality`, `maintenance`, `security`, `compliance`
- `licenses`, `dependencies`

### Customizing Schedules

Modify the cron expressions to fit your needs:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 2 * * *" # Daily at 2 AM UTC
  - cron: "0 */4 * * *" # Every 4 hours
  - cron: "0 3 * * 0" # Weekly on Sundays at 3 AM UTC
```

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Automated Reports

The workflows generate several automated reports:

1. **Weekly Issue Summary**: Created every Monday
2. **Security Scan Results**: Daily security vulnerability reports
3. **Code Quality Metrics**: Weekly code quality analysis
4. **Deployment Status**: Real-time deployment tracking

### Artifacts

Workflows store artifacts for:

- Code quality reports (30 days retention)
- Test coverage reports (30 days retention)
- Build artifacts (30 days retention)
- Security scan results (uploaded to GitHub Security tab)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Permissions**:

   ```
   Error: Resource not accessible by integration
   ```

   **Solution**: Check workflow permissions in repository settings

2. **Missing Secrets**:

   ```
   Error: Secret AZURE_CREDENTIALS not found
   ```

   **Solution**: Add required secrets in repository settings

3. **Tool Installation Failures**:
   ```
   Error: pip install failed
   ```
   **Solution**: Check requirements.txt and tool versions

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting repository secrets:

```
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true
```

### Manual Workflow Triggers

All workflows support manual triggering:

1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure any required inputs

## üîÑ Workflow Dependencies

Understanding workflow relationships:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Push] --> B[Code Quality Automation]
    A --> C[Security Automation]
    B --> D[Deployment Automation]
    C --> D
    E[Release Tag] --> F[Release Automation]
    F --> D
    G[Schedule] --> H[Automated Maintenance]
    G --> I[Intelligent Issue Management]
    G --> C
    G --> B
```

## üìà Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**:

   - Create feature branch
   - Code quality checks run on PR
   - Security scans validate changes
   - Merge triggers deployment to development

2. **Release Process**:

   - Create release tag
   - Automated build and validation
   - Deploy to staging for testing
   - Deploy to production after approval

3. **Maintenance**:
   - Daily automated cleanup
   - Weekly quality reports
   - Continuous security monitoring

### Performance Optimization

- Use workflow concurrency limits for resource management
- Cache dependencies where possible
- Use matrix builds for parallel execution
- Skip unnecessary workflows with path filters

## ü§ù Contributing

To add new automation workflows:

1. Create workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
2. Follow existing naming convention
3. Include proper documentation
4. Add appropriate triggers and permissions
5. Test with manual dispatch before enabling schedules
