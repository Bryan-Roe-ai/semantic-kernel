## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Manual Logging in Your Code
```python
from ai_monitoring_integration import get_logger

# Get a logger for your agent
logger = get_logger("MyAgent")

# Log different types of activities
logger.thought("I need to optimize this function")
logger.decision("Use algorithm X", "Better performance", ["X", "Y"])
logger.action("optimize_function", improvement=23.5)
logger.analysis("performance_test", cpu_usage=45.2)
```

### Track Actions with Context
```python
from ai_monitoring_integration import track_ai_action

async def my_ai_function():
    async with track_ai_action("MyAgent", "complex_analysis"):
        result = await perform_analysis()
        return result
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. **Debug AI Behavior**
- See exactly what decisions your AI agents are making
- Trace the reasoning behind actions
- Identify bottlenecks and performance issues

### 2. **Monitor Performance**
- Track agent execution times
