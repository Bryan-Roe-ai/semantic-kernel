## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation

```
User: Hello, what can you do?
AGI: 🧠 Neural-Symbolic AGI Activated

Hello! I'm your Neural-Symbolic AGI Assistant. I combine:
• Neural Networks for pattern recognition and learning
• Symbolic Reasoning for logical inference and explanation
• Knowledge Graphs for structured understanding
• Interpretable AI for transparent decision-making
```

### Reasoning Task

```
User: If all birds can fly, and penguins are birds, can penguins fly?
Reasoning Agent: 🔍 Logical Reasoning Analysis

Premises Identified: 2
• All birds can fly
• Penguins are birds

Logical Structure: IMPLIES, ALL

Reasoning Process:
1. Premise Extraction: Identified 2 logical premises
2. Logical Structure Analysis: Found universal quantifier
3. Inference Engine: Applied modus ponens
4. Conclusion Derivation: Logical contradiction detected
```

### Creative Task

```
User: Help me brainstorm innovative solutions for urban transportation
Creative Agent: 🎨 Creative Exploration

Analogical Thinking: Found connections to biological systems, network theory, fluid dynamics

Creative Associations:
• Novel perspective: Cities as living organisms with circulation systems

## 🔗 Integration with Semantic Kernel

This system integrates with your existing Semantic Kernel setup:

```python
# Connect to your AGI notebook
from agi_chat_integration import agi_system

# Process messages through your neural-symbolic system
response = await agi_system.process_chat_message(
    message="Your question",
    agent_type="neural-symbolic",
    history=conversation_history
)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Extension not loading**

   - Check that TypeScript compiled successfully
