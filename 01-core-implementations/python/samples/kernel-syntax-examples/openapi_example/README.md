# OpenAPI Example

## Running the OpenAPI syntax example

1. In a terminal, navigate to `semantic_kernel/python/samples/kernel-syntax-examples/openapi_example`.

2. Run `poetry install` followed by `poetry shell` to enter poetry's virtual environment.

3. Start the server by running `python openapi_server.py`.

4. In another terminal, do steps 1 & 2. Then, run `python openapi_client.py`, which will register a plugin representing the API defined in openapi.yaml
