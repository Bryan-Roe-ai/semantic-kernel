## Configuration
Detailed steps to configure the project.

## Workflows
### Handling 'Not Found' Error
We have added a new workflow to handle the "Not Found" error.

#### Configuration
To configure the new workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new workflow file**: Add a new workflow file `.github/workflows/handle-not-found-error.yml`.
2. **Define the workflow**: Add the following content to the file:
    ```yaml
    name: Handle Not Found Error
    on:
      pull_request:
        types: [opened, synchronize]
    jobs:
      handle-not-found-error:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Check for Not Found Error
            run: |
              echo "Checking for Not Found error..."
              echo "Handling Not Found error..."
    ```
3. **Run the workflow**: The workflow will automatically run on pull request events.

### SSRF Detection
Include detailed steps and explanations for the SSRF detection workflow.

## Branch Protection Rules
Explain the branch protection rules and include a link to the GitHub documentation on branch protection.

## CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency
### Parallel Jobs
Modify `.circleci/config.yml` to run `test`, `build`, and `deploy` jobs in parallel.

### Caching
Implement Docker layer caching in `.github/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml`.

### Multi-Stage Builds
Use multi-stage Docker builds in `.github/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml`.

### Automation of Issue Management
Add auto-labeling and auto-assigning logic in `.github/workflows/label-issues.yml`.

## Contributing
Provide guidelines for contributing, reporting issues, and requesting features. Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` if it exists.

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "main" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "main" ]
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 0 * * 0'

   jobs:
     ssrf-detection:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Run SSRF detection
           run: |
             # Add your SSRF detection script or tool here
             echo "Running SSRF detection..."
   ```

3. **Run the workflow**: The workflow will automatically run on push, pull request, and scheduled events. It will detect and address any SSRF vulnerabilities in the codebase.

By following these steps, you can ensure that SSRF vulnerabilities are detected and addressed in your codebase, enhancing the security of your project.

## New Workflow for Handling "Not Found" Error

We have added a new workflow to handle the "Not Found" error when trying to use GitHub Copilot workspace on pull requests. This workflow is designed to detect and address the specific error.

### Configuration

To configure the new workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new workflow file**: Add a new workflow file named `.github/workflows/handle-not-found-error.yml` to the repository.

2. **Define the workflow**: Add the following content to the workflow file:

   ```yaml
   name: Handle Not Found Error

   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize]

   jobs:
     handle-not-found-error:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Check for Not Found Error
           run: |
             # Add your script or tool to check for the Not Found error here
             echo "Checking for Not Found error..."
             # Handle the Not Found error appropriately
             echo "Handling Not Found error..."
   ```

3. **Run the workflow**: The workflow will automatically run on pull request events. It will detect and address the "Not Found" error when trying to use GitHub Copilot workspace on pull requests.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the "Not Found" error is detected and addressed in your codebase, enhancing the functionality of your project.
