## üöÄ Overview

This is an advanced artificial intelligence development framework created by Bryan Roe. It represents significant original work building upon the semantic kernel paradigm with extensive enhancements and new capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced AI Integration**: Sophisticated AI and machine learning capabilities
- **Semantic Computing**: Enhanced semantic kernel implementation
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and .NET implementations
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Development tools and utilities
- **Automation Workflows**: GitHub Actions for maintenance, issue management,
  security scanning, code quality checks, releases, and deployment
- **Production Ready**: Robust deployment and infrastructure support

## üìÅ Project Structure

This repository is organized into several key areas:

- `01-core-implementations/` - Core semantic kernel implementations
- `02-ai-workspace/` - AI development workspace and tools
- `03-development-tools/` - Development utilities and samples
- `04-infrastructure/` - Infrastructure and deployment configurations
- `05-documentation/` - Project documentation
- `06-deployment/` - Deployment scripts and configurations
- `07-resources/` - Shared resources and assets
- `08-archived-versions/` - Historical versions and archives
- `09-agi-development/` - Advanced AGI development components

## ü§ñ Automation Features

This project includes an extensive set of GitHub Actions workflows to
automatically maintain the repository and streamline development. Workflows cover
maintenance tasks, intelligent issue management, security scanning, code quality
analysis, release automation, and multi-environment deployment. See
[`04-infrastructure/.github/workflows/`](04-infrastructure/.github/workflows/)
for full details.
