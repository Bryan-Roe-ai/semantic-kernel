## Configuration
Detailed steps to configure the project.

## Workflows
### Handling 'Not Found' Error
We have added a new workflow to handle the "Not Found" error.

#### Configuration
To configure the new workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new workflow file**: Add a new workflow file `.github/workflows/handle-not-found-error.yml`.
2. **Define the workflow**: Add the following content to the file:
    ```yaml
    name: Handle Not Found Error
    on:
      pull_request:
        types: [opened, synchronize]
    jobs:
      handle-not-found-error:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Check for Not Found Error
            run: |
              echo "Checking for Not Found error..."
              echo "Handling Not Found error..."
    ```
3. **Run the workflow**: The workflow will automatically run on pull request events.

### SSRF Detection
Include detailed steps and explanations for the SSRF detection workflow.

## Branch Protection Rules
Explain the branch protection rules and include a link to the GitHub documentation on branch protection.

## CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency
### Parallel Jobs
Modify `.circleci/config.yml` to run `test`, `build`, and `deploy` jobs in parallel.

### Caching
Implement Docker layer caching in `.github/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml`.

### Multi-Stage Builds
Use multi-stage Docker builds in `.github/workflows/azure-container-webapp.yml`.

### Automation of Issue Management
Add auto-labeling and auto-assigning logic in `.github/workflows/label-issues.yml`.
