## Public Community Office Hours

We regularly have Community Office Hours that are open to the **public** to join.

Add Semantic Kernel events to your calendar - we're running two community calls to cater different timezones for Q&A Office Hours:

- Americas timezone: download the [calendar.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar) file.
- Asia Pacific timezone: download the [calendar-APAC.ics](https://aka.ms/sk-community-calendar-apac) file.

If you have any questions or if you would like to showcase your project(s), please email what you'd like us to cover here: skofficehours[at]microsoft.com.

If you are unable to make it live, all meetings will be recorded and posted online.
