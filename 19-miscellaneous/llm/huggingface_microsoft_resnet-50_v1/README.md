# ResNet optimization

This folder contains examples of ResNet optimization using different workflows.
- QDQ for Qualcomm NPU / AMD NPU
- OpenVINO for Intel NPU

## QDQ for Qualcomm NPU / AMD NPU

This workflow performs ResNet optimization with QDQ in one workflow. It performs the optimization pipeline:

- *PyTorch Model -> Onnx Model -> Quantized Onnx Model*

## Evaluation result

The quantization uses 256 samples from train split of imagenet-1k dataset and the evaluations uses 256 samples from test split of imagenet-1k dataset.
