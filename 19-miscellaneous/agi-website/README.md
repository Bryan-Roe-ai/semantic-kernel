## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Simple Setup

1. Clone or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. That's it! The website is fully functional

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Using Python (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if installed)
npx serve .

# Using PHP (if installed)
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 3: Launch with AGI Backend

Use the provided helper script to start both the website and the AGI MCP server automatically:

```bash
python ../11-automation-scripts/launch_agi_website.py
```

This opens the site in your browser once the backend is ready.

## 🎯 AGI Chat Demo Capabilities

The interactive chat demo responds intelligently to various topics:

### Supported Conversation Types

- **Educational Explanations**: "Explain quantum computing to a 10-year-old"
- **Creative Writing**: "Write a haiku about artificial intelligence"
- **Problem Solving**: "How would you solve climate change?"
- **Philosophy**: "Analyze the philosophical implications of consciousness"
- **General Questions**: Open-ended conversations about AI and technology

### Example Prompts

- "What are you?" / "How do you work?"
- "Tell me about the future of AI"
- "What makes AGI different from regular AI?"
- "How can AGI help humanity?"

## 🛠️ Customization

### Colors and Themes

The website uses CSS custom properties for easy theme customization:

```css
:root {
  --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  --text-color: #333;
  --background-color: #f8f9fa;
  --card-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Adding New Chat Responses

Edit the `agiResponses` object in `script.js`:

```javascript
const agiResponses = {
  "your new prompt": "Your AGI response here",
  // ... existing responses
};
```

### Modifying Sections

Each section is clearly marked in the HTML with semantic IDs:

- `#home` - Hero section
- `#about` - About AGI
- `#capabilities` - Capabilities timeline
- `#research` - Research areas
- `#demo` - Interactive demo
- `#contact` - Contact section

## 🔧 Integration with Semantic Kernel

This website is designed to be easily integrated with Microsoft's Semantic Kernel:

### Ready for Backend Integration

- Chat interface can be connected to real AI models
- API endpoints can replace the mock responses
- User authentication can be added
- Real-time AI processing integration

### Semantic Kernel Connection Points

```javascript
// Replace mock responses with Semantic Kernel API calls
async function generateAGIResponse(input) {
  const response = await fetch("/api/semantic-kernel/chat", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: input }),
  });
  return await response.json();
}
```
