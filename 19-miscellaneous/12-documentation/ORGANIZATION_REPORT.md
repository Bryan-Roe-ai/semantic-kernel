# Repository Organization Report

**Date**: 2025-06-15 22:45:17
**Organizer**: Advanced Repository Organization Script

## 🎯 Summary

The semantic-kernel repository has been comprehensively organized into a logical structure that improves:
- **Navigation**: Clear directory hierarchy
- **Development**: Separated concerns by purpose
- **Maintenance**: Archived old versions and cleaned duplicates
- **Compatibility**: Symlinks maintain existing workflows

## 📊 Organization Statistics

### Directories Organized
- ✅ Core implementations: 4 language directories
- ✅ AI workspace: Centralized AI development tools
- ✅ Development tools: Notebooks, samples, tests
- ✅ Infrastructure: Scripts, configs, CI/CD
- ✅ Documentation: Guides and references
- ✅ Deployment: Containers and scripts
- ✅ Resources: Data and models
- ✅ Archives: Legacy versions

### Files Cleaned
- 🗑️ Duplicate files moved to `.cleanup/duplicates/`
- 🗑️ Temporary files moved to `.cleanup/temp/`
- 🗑️ System files moved to `.cleanup/system_files/`
- 🗑️ Temp IDs moved to `.cleanup/temp_ids/`

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All moved directories have symlinks in their original locations to ensure:
- Existing scripts continue to work
- Build processes remain functional
- Development workflows are not disrupted

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review**: Check `.cleanup/` directories for any files you need
2. **Test**: Verify your workflows still function correctly
3. **Update**: Update any hardcoded paths in your scripts
4. **Clean**: After verification, you can safely delete `.cleanup/`

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues or need to restore files:
1. Check `.cleanup/` directories
2. Use symlinks to access moved directories
3. Refer to `REPOSITORY_INDEX.md` for the complete structure
