# Contributing to the Semantic Kernel Fork

## Overview

This fork focuses on AGI development, performance optimization, and experimental AI features. We welcome contributions that advance these goals while maintaining compatibility with the upstream Semantic Kernel.

## Types of Contributions

### 1. AGI Research Contributions
- Novel cognitive architectures
- Advanced reasoning algorithms
- Meta-cognitive monitoring systems
- AGI orchestration patterns

**Requirements:**
- Theoretical background documentation
- Experimental validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Safety considerations

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Execution engine improvements
- Memory optimization
- Parallel processing enhancements
- Caching strategies

**Requirements:**
- Before/after performance metrics
- Benchmark test results
- Regression testing
- Documentation of trade-offs

### 3. Experimental Features
- Cutting-edge AI techniques
- Research prototypes
- Advanced algorithms
- Novel integration patterns

**Requirements:**
- Feature flag implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation with examples
- Risk assessment

## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bryankr22/semantic-kernel.git
cd semantic-kernel
git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/agi-enhancement-description
```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Include integration tests for new features
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

#### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation
- Add code examples
- Include performance impact notes
- Document any breaking changes

#### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit

# Run integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration

# Run performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance
```

### 4. Submission Process

#### Pull Request Requirements
- [ ] Clear description of changes
- [ ] Related issue linked
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

#### Review Process
1. Automated testing and validation
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Performance impact assessment
4. Integration testing
5. Final approval and merge

## Experimental Features

### Feature Flag System
All experimental features must use the feature flag system:

```python
from semantic_kernel.experimental import FeatureManager

@FeatureManager.experimental_feature("new_agi_capability")
def new_agi_function():
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Safety Guidelines
- All experimental features must be disabled by default
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide fallback mechanisms
- Document potential risks

## Research Collaboration

### Academic Partnerships
We welcome collaboration with:
- AI research institutions
- AGI development teams
- Performance optimization researchers
- Cognitive science researchers

### Publishing and Citation
- Contributors retain rights to their contributions
- Research using this fork should cite appropriately
- Academic publications should acknowledge contributors
- Open data and reproducibility encouraged

## Upstream Contributions

### Contributing Back to Microsoft Semantic Kernel
We actively contribute improvements back to the upstream repository:

1. **Bug Fixes**: All bug fixes are contributed upstream
2. **General Features**: Non-AGI-specific features are offered upstream
3. **Performance Improvements**: General optimizations are shared
4. **Documentation**: Improvements that benefit everyone

### Contribution Process
1. Develop feature in this fork
2. Validate with research community
3. Generalize for broader use
4. Submit to upstream repository
5. Maintain in both repositories

## Communication
