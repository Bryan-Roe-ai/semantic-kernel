- `README.md`: The main documentation file for the repository, providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
- `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation for each major component of the repository.
- `java/`: Contains the Java implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `dotnet/`: Contains the .NET implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `python/`: Contains the Python implementation of the Semantic Kernel.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for automating various tasks and processes.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases and testing infrastructure for the project.
