# Code Comments and Documentation

This document provides guidelines and examples for adding comments and documentation to the code in this repository. Proper comments and documentation are essential for maintaining code readability, understanding, and ease of use.

## General Guidelines

1. **Commenting Functions and Classes**: Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function and class. This helps other developers understand the code and its intended use.

2. **Docstrings in Python**: Use docstrings to provide detailed descriptions of functions, classes, and modules in Python files. Docstrings should include information about parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised.

3. **Javadoc Comments in Java**: Use Javadoc comments to document classes, methods, and fields in Java files. Javadoc comments should provide detailed descriptions of the code, including information about parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be thrown.

4. **Public Functions and Classes**: Ensure that all public functions and classes have clear and concise documentation comments. This helps users understand how to use the public API of the repository.

## Examples

### Python Example

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers and return the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b
```

### Java Example

```java
/**
 * Add two numbers and return the result.
 *
 * @param a The first number.
 * @param b The second number.
 * @return The sum of the two numbers.
 */
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Write comments and documentation that are easy to understand. Avoid using jargon or complex language.

2. **Keep Comments Up to Date**: Ensure that comments and documentation are updated whenever the code changes. Outdated comments can be misleading and confusing.

3. **Use Proper Formatting**: Follow the formatting conventions for comments and documentation in the respective programming languages. This helps maintain consistency and readability.

4. **Provide Examples**: Include examples in the documentation to demonstrate how to use the functions and classes. Examples help users understand the practical usage of the code.

5. **Document Edge Cases**: Mention any edge cases or special conditions that the code handles. This helps users understand the limitations and expected behavior of the code.

## Best Practices for Resolving Issues

1. **Adhere to Best Practices**: Ensure that the code changes adhere to the best practices outlined in this document. This includes proper commenting, documentation, and code quality.

2. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality by following coding standards and guidelines. This includes writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

3. **Review Process**: Implement a review process where resolved issues are reviewed and approved by trusted people before being closed. This helps ensure that the changes adhere to best practices and meet the required standards.

4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the code changes to ensure that they work as expected and do not introduce any new issues. This includes writing unit tests, integration tests, and performing manual testing if necessary.

5. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect the changes made to the code. This includes updating code comments, docstrings, and any relevant documentation files.

## Examples of Well-Documented Code

### Python Example

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiply two numbers and return the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.

    Returns:
    int: The product of the two numbers.
    """
    return a * b
```

### Java Example

```java
/**
 * Multiply two numbers and return the result.
 *
 * @param a The first number.
 * @param b The second number.
 * @return The product of the two numbers.
 */
public int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

By following these guidelines and best practices, we can ensure that the code in this repository is well-documented and easy to understand for all developers.
