This will show you how different AI block types are processed.

```md {"id":"01JYHMJK5ZP5ZTBKGN6ZREGY0A"}
python3 ai_markdown_runner.py simple_ai_demo.md
```bash
Try running:


- **Semantic Kernel**: Integrate with SK AI services
- **AGI MCP Server**: Use your existing MCP setup
- **Local LLM**: Connect to local language models 
- **OpenAI API**: Add your API key and integrate OpenAI client

Currently, the runner provides simulated results. To connect real AI:


3. Any `.md` file - The runner will analyze it even without AI blocks
2. `ai_demo.md` - More complex AI processing examples
1. `simple_ai_demo.md` - Demonstrates all AI block types


```
