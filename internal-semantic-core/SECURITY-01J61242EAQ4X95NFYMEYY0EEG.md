<!-- BEGIN MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD V0**.8 BLOCK -->

## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft](ht************************ft), [Azure](ht********************re), [DotNet](ht*********************et), [AspNet](ht*********************et), [Xamarin](ht**********************in), and [our GitHub organizations](ht****************************om/).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vu*********ty](ht*****************************************************************************=1), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [ht************************************rt](ht********************************************rt).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](ht***************************************************=2).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [mi*********om/msrc](ht**************************************=2).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Pr***am](ht*********************************************=2) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Di******re](ht******************************************=2).
