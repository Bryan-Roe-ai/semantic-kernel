# Samples

Curated runnable examples illustrating usage patterns. This directory is under phased migration; some examples still reside at repository root until shims are removed.

Subdirectories:

- `local_ai/` – Running Semantic Kernel with local models.
- `agents/` – Simple agent and multi-agent examples.
- `ai_types/` – Demonstrates different AI interaction modes and content types.
- `markdown/` – Markdown processing / AI markdown demos.

Refer to root `ORGANIZATION_PROPOSAL.md` for migration plan.
