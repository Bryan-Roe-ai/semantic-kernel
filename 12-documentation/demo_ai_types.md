# Deprecated: AI Types Demo Markdown

This legacy demonstration markdown has been consolidated into the structured samples area.

Canonical location: samples/markdown/ (see README for combined multi-type examples)

Reason: reduce root clutter and duplication; unify AI markdown examples.

Action: use the new samples under `samples/markdown/` for current guidance.

<!-- DEPRECATION STUB: moved/merged into samples/markdown/ -->
