## Genie

The error `Syntax error on token ":", . expected` in Java usually occurs when there is an unexpected colon somewhere in the code. In your case, it looks like the issue is with the line containing `TODO:`.

### Explanation

In Java, the `TODO:` comment isn't a special syntax; it's just a part of a regular comment. However, if you forget to complete a string statement or mistakenly include a colon outside of a comment block, it can lead to such a syntax error.

### Suggested Fix

It seems like you have a `TODO` comment that's causing issues because it is not properly formatted as a comment, or there's some other syntax error surrounding it. Ensure that the `TODO` part is inside a comment and review nearby code for correctness.

Here's a corrected version:

```java
// means that the code needs to be modified to enable the injection of a skill store, likely for
// dependency injection or other design considerations.
// TODO: allow to inject skill store

/**
 * Your method or class documentation goes here.
 */

// Rest of your code
```

### Additional Note

- Make sure you do not have any incomplete statements or misplaced colons elsewhere in your code.
- If this doesn't fix the issue, double-check for other syntax errors in lines above or below the mention of `TODO`.

By ensuring the `TODO` is within comments and checking for syntax errors around it, you should be able to resolve the issue.
