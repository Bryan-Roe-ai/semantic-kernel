# Java Syntax Error Resolution Guide

## Error Description

Explain the following error that was seen in Java code and suggest a fix if possible: 
**Syntax error on token ":", . expected Java (1610612940)**

## Error Context

```java
// means that the code needs to be modified to enable the injection of a skill store, likely for
// dependency injection or other design considerations.

### Additional Notes
Make sure you do not have any incomplete statements or misplaced colons elsewhere in your code.
