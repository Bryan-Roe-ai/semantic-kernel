## Quickstart

To run the LLM prompts and semantic functions in this kernel, make sure you have
an [Open AI API Key](https://openai.com/product/)

To get an idea of how to use the Semantic Kernel for Java, you can check
the [syntax-examples](samples/semantickernel-concepts/semantickernel-syntax-examples/src/main/java/com/microsoft/semantickernel/samples/syntaxexamples) folder for
examples of common AI-enabled scenarios.

### Testing locally

The project may contain end-to-end tests that require an OpenAI key to run. To run these tests locally, you
will need to set the following environment variable:

- `CLIENT_KEY` - the OpenAI API key.

If you are using Azure OpenAI, you will also need to set the following environment variables:

To run the unit tests only, run the following command:

    ./mvnw package

To run all tests, including integration tests that require an OpenAI key, run the following command:

    ./mvnw verify -Prelease,bug-check,with-samples

### Submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure that you have run the project with the command:

```sh {"id":"01J60NT1RARPW34SFZRYRX3Z7P"}
./mvnw clean package -Pbug-check
```

The bug-check profile will detect some static analysis issues that will prevent merging as well as apply formatting
requirements to the code base.

Also ensure that:

- All new code is covered by unit tests
- All new code is covered by integration tests

The Semantic Kernel for Java code has moved
to [semantic-kernel-java](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel-java), please make code changes and submit issues
to that repository. This move is purely to ease the development. The various Semantic Kernel languages are all still
aligned in their development.

Project coordination is still performed within this [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/866).
